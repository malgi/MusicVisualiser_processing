MUSIC VISUALIZER
PV251 project
-----------------
Markéta Hanušová

Application for visualizing music in mp3 format.

The application visualize loaded music. For the school project purpose I have loaded
three default songs (which is enough for demonstration of how the visualizing works).
You can switch between the songs in menu. If you are not satisfied with the songs 
choice, feel free to replace the songs in drectory (just keep old names).

You are also able to customize the music visualizer environment and style. Firstly
just click with your mouse to hide the text and enjoy just the pure visualiztion.
There is 4 different color themes for choice and 3 different styles of visualizing.
More about changing styles and controling in "CONTROL" section.

The application was programmed in Processing language. For managing an mp3 files
was used Minim audio library (Java). The visualizer processes data from audio
buffer and detects beats in music. Moreover it gets meta data from mp3 file to
show the title of the song and reamining time.
